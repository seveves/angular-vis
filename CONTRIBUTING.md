## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix. But first search if the issue is already described!

If not create a new issue:

* Tell about your environment:
  * node version
  * nativescript version
  * used platform and version√ç
* Describe your issue
  * describe your steps leading to the issue
  * attach error logs or screenshots
  * if possible provide test case or screenshots

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github].

Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews - if you don't you'll probably just be asked to anyway.**

* Please rebase your branch against the current develop, use the **develop** for pull requests
* Please ensure that the test suite passes **and** that code is lint free before submitting a PR by running:
 * ```npm test```
* If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behaviour
* Make reference to possible [issues](https://github.com/hypery2k/ngx-vis/issues) on PR comment

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more [specs][unit-testing].
* All public API methods **must be documented** with jsdoc.
